# ODINv2 - Open Source Command and Control Information System (C2IS)

ODINv2 is the successor of [ODINv1](https://github.com/syncpoint/ODIN). ODIN has been completely rewritten and enables a wide range of new features such as layer-level links and styles, searchable `#tag`s for features, layers, symbols, etc.

## Online collaboration
Replication in a distributed command and control environment by making use of the [[matrix]](https://matrix.org) ecosystem is here. Make sure to join our [[matrix] ODIN Community Chat Room](https://matrix.to/#/#ODIN.Community:syncpoint.io) to get the latest news about ODIN.

## Migration from ODINv1

ODINv2 will migrate all of your existing ODINv1 projects on first start. You will be able to further use ODINv1 in parallel but we will not update newly or updated projects after the first start of ODINv2. If you do have any 
ODINv1 layer files (*.json) you can import them at any time via drag&drop onto the ODINv2 map.

## Configuration via environment

### Self-Update

Self-Update is enabled by default and ODIN will check for newer versions. In order to disable Self-Update
one can use the environment variable `ODIN_SELF_UPDATE` with a value of `0`.

### OpenStreetMap Nominatim

If you are not connected to the Internet and you want to use the "Search for places" function you need to host your own OSM [Nominatim server](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/latest/admin/Installation/). In order
to make ODIN use your on-premise instance of Nominatim you cat use the environment variable `NOMINATIM_URL`. The default value for this parameter is `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search`.

## Host your own map server

You are an offline-first user and want to host your own map server (i.e. on your laptop)? GeoWebServer is way to big and uses too many resources? Just fire up [mbtileserver](https://github.com/consbio/mbtileserver), provide a _mbtile_ file that contains all your map tiles and you are done.
